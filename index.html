                Om Sri Krishnah sharanam namah: This chant is a call to the beloved Lord Krishna where you pray to him to take you
          under his shelter, surrendering yourself to him with utmost devotion.<br>
                This mantra is said to take away all the grief and miseries from your life and mind, giving you peace.<br>
                According to Lord Krishna, the first step is to gain clarity on any situation by developing a clear, calm and collected mind.<br>
                The Mahabharata features the divine discus as a weapon of Krishna, identified with Vishnu.
                The deity beheads Shishupala with the Sudarshana Chakra at the rajasuya yajna of Emperor Yudhishthira.
